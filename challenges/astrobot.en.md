We have found that HARPA is using a game for employee recruitment. It is based on the old AstroBlast [https://youtu.be/rn3RPIIC9gM?t=26](https://youtu.be/rn3RPIIC9gM?t=26).

Your mission is to automate a solution (bot) to dodge obstacles and capture asteroids (represented by asterisks).
Hold on for **137 seconds** and you're hired!

Instructions:

 * Use the arrow keys to change the spaceship direction.
 * Use the spacebar to reverse the spaceship direction.
 * Press "q" to exit at any moment.
 * When the game is over, you can close the game with "q" or "spacebar".
 * The screen shows the spaceship position and the number of captured asteroids.

For latency reasons, we recommend you to use a box on DigitalOcean:
