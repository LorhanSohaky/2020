The Organization is suspecting our activity in 2019. To stop us, the conglomerate has sent two Squads for this year. Our team has intercepted the communication between the two Squads that are working cooperatively. During the analysis of the intercepted data, our experts identified the parameters of an encrypted communication. However, they could not retrieve the original message. We are sending the binary, collected from one of the hacked Organization servers, used to encrypt the message and the parameteres identified by our team. Can you help us with this task?
