While analyzing data obtained through our cyber operations, our analysts have discovered an old service in HARPA infrastructure. This service has been used to store the agency's secrets, but it has been replaced by a more sophisticated one after a few years. By mistake, this service remained available on Internet until December 2019, when HARPA agents realized this flaw and took it down. We suspect this service is vulnerable. We need your help to exploit its vulnerability and extract the secrets that are still kept on the server.

**Server:** 200.136.252.34 1245

**Server backup:** 68.183.204.108 1245
