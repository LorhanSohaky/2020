After you solved for Part 1, we found a HARPA Rocket RISC-V system at `iot.pwn2.win`. We need to own a root shell in this system through SSH. To get this done, it is not enough to know the trigger string. We need to understand how the 64-bit word written just after the trigger string affects the control flow and how this can be employed to compromise the Dropbear server. We are counting on you: get a shell and submit the contents of `/root/flag`.

**Server**: `iot.pwn2.win`
