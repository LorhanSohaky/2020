Our members had access to a place where a secret meeting of the Organization was happing. During the meeting, they discussed about out work in 2019 and sent detailed commands to the Squads through "Internet Relay System". We had luck! Our group was abble to collect the service program used to authenticate the Squads, and left there without being noticed. Becuse the message self-destroys, all the Squads must be together for the reception.

Each Squad has a token (private key) that matches with a public key. The keys of all Squads must be combined and sent to the service in order to authenticate properly and get the instructions. I'm sending to you the information collected by this group. Your mission is to find out what are the next steps of the Squads and be ready for their actions. Because we are having progress, they clearly are desperate.
