rafael_p (aka rafaeleeto), a former member of Rebellious Fingers, have defected to Butcher Corp, HARPA's great ally that is responsible for its activities in Eastern Europe. After discovering his identity and his great skills in Botnets, he was extremely harassed by them and, with an undeniable proposal, he eventually cheated on the RF and went work with the enemy. When he was one of ours, he was working on a complex, innovative, multi-security bot that would be a Botnets Manager (a central bot concept, which triggers commands for all others). We know he is still working on this project there and for the sake of discretion in testing he is quietly using a real IRC network as Command and Control. Fortunately we have a dump of a machine he used during tests and it can be a good starting point! Try owning the bot and discovering the nicknames of all the admins on the channel, as we suspect other RF members are cheating on us and helping him behind our backs!
