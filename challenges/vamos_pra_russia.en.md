Our cyber explorers got access to a HARPA mail server in Russia and one of the messages caught our attention. Apparently, the Organization managed to corrupt a HARPA employee. On the first contact made after the corruption, an Organization member sent him a program to be used to encrypt messages leaking agency data. The agency employee's response already contained an encrypted message.

We believe this employee was responsible for leaking Sophia code details. We are sending the program sent by the Organization member and the encrypted message parameters to that you can gain access to these details and use them to prevent the feature of sending messages to the past being created.
